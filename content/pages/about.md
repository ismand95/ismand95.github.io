### Who I am

I am an aspiring data-analyst, who has a massive in everything tech-related.
I am a major open-source and Linux enthusiast and have spent countless hours working with all kinds of technology.
I am always looking for new projects and ideas to pursue within my spare time.

I am a former student employee and Junior Analyst at a Danish consultancy 
and current board member of FinanceLab Aarhus. 

Right now, I am primarily interested in Econometrics, data-analytics and ML. 

### What I do

I am a student at Aarhus University currently pursuing a Bachelors in Economics.
I am highly interested in finance and think the most interesting problems within statistics and ecnonomics are those
that can be solved in code. 

### About this blog

I strive to keep this blog rather updated. The contents are not strictly either
technology-related or in English. My goal is to write about what spikes sudden strokes
of interest in my everyday life - which is highly probable to be technology related in some way.
