<hr/>
<p>Exactly one year ago, I got to feel the ground of my home country beneath my feet after
a few months of backpacking Central America. I returned home with immense energy and a 
longing for new and exciting opportunities.</p>
<p>As one does when returning home after long travels, I went to visit all my old friends and 
hear about how their lives had ventured in my time away. One of these long summer-nights
was particularly amazing. Not only did I get to spend quality time with one of the people
who probably is the biggest inspiration for me actually choosing to travel, but she showed
me this amazing new "app" she'd found. It was called 1 Second Everyday. </p>
<h2>The App itself</h2>
<p>The concept of the <a href="https://1se.co/">1 Second Everyday</a> (1SE) app is sort of self-explainatory.
You create one second long snippets of video every day as a sort of diary. 
I think 1 Second Everyday says it best in this quote from their website. </p>
<blockquote>
<p><i>"Imagine a movie that includes every day of the rest of your life. Let 1 Second Everyday help you remember your journey and create the story of your life."</i></p>
</blockquote>
<p>I needed no further introduction - this would be the perfect tool for me to document my 
upcoming travels!</p>
<h2>Starting my one second adventure</h2>
<p>My summer of 2018 was going to be travel-filled as well. I'd bought my interrail-pass months before in the 
winter and was "ready-set" to begin this amazing journey with a very close friend. We started
out traveling around almost all of Continental Europe and every day of the amazing trip
I carried with me my newly found companion, 1 Second Everyday. I think my friends and close
relatives are tired of hearing about all the travels, so I'll spare you the details - needless
to say, whether you're an experienced backpacker or newly introduced: GO INTERRAILING!</p>
<p>I very quickly found that using the 1SE app generated an amazing way to remember and reflect upon my 
experiences. So much so that I choose to continue my video-diary months after my traveling was over.</p>
<p>It's now been a year since I began recording and thankfully I had the tenacity to keep adding my recorded video-snippets
every single one of the past 365 days.</p>
<h2>Reflecting upon the experience</h2>
<p>It's funny to look back on a year - guess it's usually something that happens around birthdays or holidays, however what 
really touched my heart was looking back at all these amazing people, with whom I've shared precious moments.
Although everyday-life quickly kicked in after Interrailling was over (and some 1 second snippets may be rather uninteresting),
I believe it is such a gift to be able to reflect in retrospect and see the smiles of all the people whom touched my life and 
helped make the last year absolutely unforgettable. </p>
<p>Well... enough introduction I guess - I hope you enjoy the video and that it may inspire some of you to video-document your own life.</p>
<p>I really can't watch it without an immense smile on my face while I reflect upon all the amazing moments this last year brought to me.</p>
